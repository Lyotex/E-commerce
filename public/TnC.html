    <p>('we', 'our', or 'us'). Please read them carefully as they affect your rights and liabilities under law. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access nor use the Website.</p>
    <p>If you have any queries regarding these Terms then please contact us.</p>

    <h2>1. Agreement</h2>
    <p>By using the Website you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Amendments</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Update these Terms from time to time and any changes will be notified to you via a suitable announcement on the Website. It is your responsibility to check for such changes. The changes will apply to the use of the Website after we have given such announcement. If you do not wish to accept the new Terms you should not continue to use the Website. If you continue to use the Website after the date on which the change comes into effect, your use of the Website indicates your agreement to be bound by the new Terms;</li>
        <li>Modify or withdraw, temporarily or permanently, this Website and the material contained within (or any part) without notice to you and you confirm that we shall not be liable to you for any modification to or withdrawal of the Website or its contents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Registration</h2>
    <p>You warrant that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The personal information which you are required to provide when you register is true, accurate, current and complete in all respects; and</li>
        <li>You are not impersonating any other person or entity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The products purchased on this site are for private and domestic use only and are not for resale. You will notify us immediately of any changes to the personal information by e-mailing or telephoning our customer service representatives at:</p>
    <p>e-mail address: <a href="mailto:customer.experience@thehutgroup.com">customer.experience@thehutgroup.com</a></p>

    <h2>4. Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We will treat all your personal information as confidential and will only use it in accordance with our Privacy Policy ```html
    .</p>
    <p>When you shop on this Website, we will ask you to input personal details in order for us to identify you, such as your name, e-mail address, billing address, delivery address, credit card or other payment information. We confirm that this information will be held by us in accordance with the registration we have with the Data Commissioner's office.</p>

    <h2>5. Protecting Your Security</h2>
    <p>To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we will validate name, address and other personal information supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third party databases.</p>
    <p>We take the risk of internet fraud very seriously. With the volume of fraudulent credit card transactions increasing, we make every effort to ensure all orders are thoroughly checked using the information already supplied. There is a possibility we may contact you to make additional security checks and we ask for your co-operation to enable us to complete them. We will not tolerate fraudulent transactions and such transactions will be reported to the relevant authorities.</p>
    <p>By accepting these terms and conditions you consent to such checks being made. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will be unaffected. All information provided by you will be treated securely and strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

    <h2>6. Compliance</h2>
    <p>The Website may only be used for lawful purposes and in a lawful manner. You agree to comply with all applicable laws, statutes and regulations regarding the Website and its use. You agree not to upload or transmit through the Website:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any computer viruses or anything else designed to interfere with, interrupt or disrupt the normal operating procedures of a computer; and</li>
        <li>Any material which is defamatory, offensive or of an obscene character.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Indemnity</h2>
    <p>You agree to fully indemnify, defend and hold us, and our officers, directors, employees and suppliers, harmless immediately on demand, from and against all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees, arising out of any breach of these Terms by you, or any other liabilities arising out of your use of this Website or any other person accessing the Website using your personal information.</p>

    <h2>8. Third Party Links</h2>
    <p>As a convenience to our customers, the Website may include links to other websites or material which is beyond our control. For your information, we are not responsible for such websites or material nor do we review or endorse them. We will not be liable, whether directly or indirectly, for the privacy practices or content of such websites nor for any damage, loss or offence caused or alleged to be caused in connection with, the use of or reliance on any such advertising, content, products, materials or services available on such external websites or resources.</p>

    <h2>9. Orders</h2>
    <p>All orders are subject to acceptance and availability. If the goods ordered are not available, you will be notified by e-mail (or by other means if no e-mail address has been provided) and you will have the option either to wait until the item is available from stock or to cancel your order.</p>
    <p>Any orders placed by you will be treated as an offer to purchase the goods or services from us and we have the right to reject such offers at any time. You acknowledge that any automated acknowledgement of your order which you may receive from us shall not amount to our acceptance of your offer to purchase goods or services advertised on the Website. The conclusion of a contract between you and us will take place when we (i) debit your credit, debit card or PayPal account or (ii) dispatch the goods to you or commence the services, whichever is the later.</p>
    <p>We will take all reasonable care, in so far as it is in our power to do so, to keep the details of your order and payment secure, but in the absence of negligence on our part we cannot be liable for any loss you may suffer if a third party procures unauthorised access to any data provided by you when accessing or ordering from the Website.</p>
    <p>The products sold on the Website are not for re-sale or distribution. You are limited to a purchase of 5 items of any one product. We reserve the right to cancel orders and/or suspend accounts where we believe products are being ordered in breach of this provision.</p>

    <p>You will assume the risk for the products once they have been delivered to the delivery address which you specified when ordering the products. We accept no liability where you provide an incorrect delivery address or where you fail to collect the products from the delivery address which you specified. Notwithstanding that risk of loss or damage to the products only passes to you once they have been delivered to the delivery address, ownership of the products shall pass to you on the later of: (a) the products being dispatched by us; and (b) us receiving payment in respect of the same.</p>

    <h2>10. Cancellation Rights</h2>
    <p>Where you have purchased the goods or services as a consumer (i.e. for private use as opposed to business use), please note that you are entitled to cancel any contract completed with us within 14 days from the day on which you acquire physical possession of the goods.</p>
    <p>If you wish to cancel a contract pursuant to this clause, then please see our Returns Policy for further details of how.</p>

    <h2>11. Price and Payment</h2>
    <p>All prices shown are inclusive of VAT (only where applicable - see below) at the current rates and are correct at the time of entering the information onto the system. We reserve the right, however, to change prices at any time without notice to you.</p>
    <p>If your delivery address is within the United Kingdom, no additional taxes will be charged to you. If your delivery address is outside of the United Kingdom you may be subject to import duties and taxes (including VAT), which are levied once a delivery reaches your destination country. Any such additional charges must be borne by you.</p>
    <p>Payment can be made by any major credit or debit card or via your PayPal account. Payment will be debited and cleared from your account before the dispatch of your good or provision of the service to you.</p>

    <h2>12. Eligibility to Purchase</h2>

    <h2>14. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Notwithstanding any other provision in the Terms, nothing in these Terms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Affect or limit your rights as a consumer under English law; or</li>
        <li>Will exclude or limit our liability for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Website is provided on an 'as is' and 'as available' basis without any representation or endorsement made and we make no warranties, whether express or implied, in relation to it and its use.</p>

    <h2>15. Severance</h2>
    <p>If any part of the Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions of the Terms.</p>

    <h2>16. Waiver</h2>
    <p>No waiver by us shall be construed as a waiver of any proceeding or succeeding breach of any provision.</p>

    <h2>17. Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>These Terms form the entire basis of any agreement reached between you and us.</p>

    <h2>18. Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales and any disputes will be decided only by the English courts.</p>

    <h2>19. Chocolate & Sweets</h2>
    <p>To make the most of your sweets we recommend that they are consumed within 12 weeks of receipt.</p>
    <p>All products are individually dated to ensure the products are consumed when they are at the best.</p>

    <h2>20. Returns</h2>
    <p>In order to ensure our customers receive the best level of service and are happy to indulge their sweet tooth we offer a comprehensive returns policy ```html
    in the unlikely event that you are not 100% satisfied with sweets delivered. Please note that the following returns procedure must be followed, and failure to do so may result in us being unable to exchange goods or provide refunds. Also please be aware that we cannot be held responsible and provide refunds/exchanges on stock affected by circumstances beyond our control. This includes damage and neglect after goods are received, goods being stored in climatic conditions such as extremes of temperature that can affect some items - items often stick together or alter appearance slightly, but will taste the same and damage by third parties. In addition please be aware that during the hot summer months goods in transport can be affected by the heat so be aware that delicate items such as chocolate may not always look as intended, but they will of course still taste as good as ever.</p>

    <p>Should you wish to return an item for any reason please notify us within 48 hours of receipt of your order of any part that is unsatisfactory. In order to arrange a return, please contact us and inform our customer service team of your order number, the item you are returning and the reason for the return.</p>

    <p>We will then reply with a unique returns authorisation number and the address you need to send the item to.</p>

    <p>You'll need to package the item securely and include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your order number</li>
        <li>The returns authorisation number</li>
        <li>Whether a replacement or refund is needed</li>
        <li>The reason why you are returning the item.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Goods returned should be in their original condition and packaging in which they arrived, along with a copy of the invoice or packing slip.</p>

    <p>Once received items will be checked and refunds on goods and postage arranged where suitable. We cannot issue refunds on simply unwanted goods due to the perishable nature of goods on sale. Refunds/exchanges will only be offered on items that are faulty, and were clearly so at the time at which they were dispatched.</p>

    <h2>21. All Competitions</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to amend these Terms without notice from time to time.</p>
    <p>These rules will be deemed incorporated into each competition except to the extent that any specific instruction in a competition provides otherwise.</p>
    <p>By entering the competition entrants will be deemed to have read and understood these Terms and be bound by them. All of our decisions will be final and binding and no correspondence will be entered into.</p>

    <h2>22. Reviews</h2>
    <p>If you submit a review, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the world in any media.</p>

    <h2>23. Mankind Gift Vouchers And Credit</h2>
    <p>The MANKIND Gift Voucher can be used to buy any item sold by www.mankind.co.uk. Our normal terms and conditions, together with the terms and conditions below, apply to the purchase of your gift voucher.</p>

    <h2>24. Gift With Products Promotions</h2>
    <p>Where we are offering a free gift with a product, we shall only provide one free gift per transaction (irrespective of how many products are purchased). The free gift is subject to availability and we reserve the right to change the free gift for a gift.</p>

    <h2>25. Referral Scheme</h2>
    <p>Subject to the terms set out below, you may earn ‘credit’ for use on this Website by referring a new customer(s) to us through our referral scheme by sharing the referral link and/or referral code we provide to you (the “Referral Scheme”).</p>

    <h2>26. Cross Border E-Commerce (CBEC) Tax - China</h2>
    <p>When you make a purchase through this delivery option, our designated carrier will provide customs clearance on your behalf. Please ensure you have provided accurate information, otherwise this will jeopardise your customs clearance.</p>
